# Reversi Move Chooser
This is a Java program that can play the game of reversi (aka Othello).

## General Information
The program uses a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to choose an optimal move.

The computer may need a moment to think at times but should not be too slow.

With its current parameters the program should beat almost any player with ease.
